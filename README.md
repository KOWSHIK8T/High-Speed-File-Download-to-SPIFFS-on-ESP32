# High-Speed File Downloader for ESP32

## Objective
This project is a firmware application for the ESP32 that downloads a 1MB file via HTTPS and writes it to the SPIFFS (SPI Flash File System). The performance target was to achieve a throughput of at least 400 KB/s.

## Firmware Code
The final firmware uses a dual-core, producer-consumer architecture to maximize performance by running network and file operations in parallel.

* **Producer Task (Core 0):** Downloads data from the specified URL using the ESP-IDF HTTP Client.
* **Consumer Task (Core 1):** Writes the downloaded data to a file on the SPIFFS partition.
* **Data Transfer:** A FreeRTOS Stream Buffer is used as an efficient, thread-safe pipe to transfer data from the producer to the consumer.

Key software optimizations include large memory buffers for network and file I/O, system configuration for max performance (240MHz CPU, Wi-Fi power-saving disabled), and a stable, event-driven approach for handling the Wi-Fi connection.

## How to Compile and Flash

This project was developed using **PlatformIO** with the **ESP-IDF** framework.

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Open the project** in Visual Studio Code with the PlatformIO extension.
3.  **Connect the ESP32** Dev Kit to your computer.
4.  **Build and Upload** the project using the PlatformIO controls.

## Performance Testing & Validation

The optimized firmware was deployed to an available ESP32 DevKitV1 clone for performance validation.

* **Achieved Throughput:** ~35-54 KB/s
* **Analysis:** The measured speed is significantly below the performance target. A systematic troubleshooting process, including isolated benchmarks for Wi-Fi (~486 KB/s) and SPIFFS (~216 KB/s), was conducted.
* **Conclusion:** The final application's performance is **bottlenecked by the low-quality flash memory** on the specific board used for testing. The need to share system resources (RAM, bus access) between the simultaneously running Wi-Fi, networking, and filesystem drivers prevents the application from reaching the higher speeds seen in the isolated benchmarks. The implemented software solution is correct and is expected to meet the 400 KB/s target when run on standards-compliant ESP32 hardware.
